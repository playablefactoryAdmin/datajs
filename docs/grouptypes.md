# Group Types

In the Data.js library, you'll find data types specifically designed for organizing and structuring data into groups or sections. These types help you create organized and structured user interfaces. This section provides documentation for the following group types:

- [Tab](tabdata.md)
- [Group](groupdata.md)

## Tab

The `Tab` data type is used to create tabbed interfaces in your applications. It allows you to organize content into different tabs or sections, making it easier for users to navigate and access specific information.
